Starting off the website will land you on a simple page showing a navbar as well as reccomend workout's. From that page one can login with the login button located on the nav bar. This will then take the user to the next page which is the login page in which there are 2 options. The first being the ability to login if an existing account exists. The second option is the sign up form. Once the user is either logged in or signed up they will then be directed to the user's personal user page. The staple for the website as a whole, the user page has the most functionallity. This includes the ability to view reccomendations based on post ratings, the ability to post notes/comments on passed workout sessions/videos, and finally a chart that (insert what chart does). In short this project is website used to tracks a persons preffrence on workouts and give more info and sessions on the matter.
